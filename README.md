I am trying to integrate backend into the user **devplusopsllc**'s repository called **admin-dashboard**. This is a humble attempt at doing that.

# The Story

I had applied to a freelance project, which required me to prove my skills by building out a feature.  Although, I have completely forgotten what the project was all about (I am updating this readme on 27 April 2025). Anyways, it was good practice. Hard work never goes wasted...except when it does, and then you just find a silver lining in the clouds hehe.
